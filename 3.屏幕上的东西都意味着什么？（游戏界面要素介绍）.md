# 3.屏幕上的东西都意味着什么？（游戏界面要素介绍）



## 英文原文

    3.  What do all those things on the screen mean?
    
         On  the screen is kept a map of where you have been and what
    you have seen on the current dungeon level; as you  explore  more
    of the level, it appears on the screen in front of you.
    
         When  NetHack's  ancestor  rogue  first appeared, its screen
    orientation was  almost  unique  among  computer  fantasy  games.
    Since  then,  screen  orientation has become the norm rather than
    the exception; NetHack continues  this  fine  tradition.   Unlike
    text  adventure games that accept commands in pseudo-English sen-
    tences and explain the results in words, NetHack commands are all
    one  or  two keystrokes and the results are displayed graphically
    on the screen.  A minimum screen size of 24 lines by  80  columns
    is  recommended;  if  the  screen is larger, only a 21x80 section
    will be used for the map.
    
         NetHack can even be played by blind players, with the assis-
    tance  of  Braille  readers or speech synthesisers.  Instructions
    for configuring NetHack for the blind are included later in  this
    document.
    
         NetHack generates a new dungeon every time you play it; even
    the authors still find it an entertaining and exciting  game  de-
    spite having won several times.
    
         NetHack  offers  a  variety of display options.  The options
    available to you will vary from port to port,  depending  on  the
    capabilities  of  your hardware and software, and whether various
    compile-time options were enabled when your executable was creat-
    ed.  The three possible display options are: a monochrome charac-
    ter interface, a color character interface, and a  graphical  in-
    terface using small pictures called tiles.  The two character in-
    terfaces allow fonts with other characters to be substituted, but
    the  default  assignments use standard ASCII characters to repre-
    sent everything.  There is no difference between the various dis-
    play options with respect to game play.  Because we cannot repro-
    duce the tiles or colors in the Guidebook, and because it is com-
    mon  to  all ports, we will use the default ASCII characters from
    the monochrome character display when  referring  to  things  you
    might see on the screen during your game.
    
         In  order  to  understand what is going on in NetHack, first
    you must understand what NetHack is doing with the  screen.   The
    NetHack  screen  replaces  the "You see ..." descriptions of text
    adventure games.  Figure 1 is a sample of what a  NetHack  screen
    might  look  like.   The  way the screen looks for you depends on
    your platform.
